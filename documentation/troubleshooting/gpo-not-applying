# GPO Not Applying – Troubleshooting

## Issue
A GPO for drive mapping was not applying on CLIENT01.

## Symptoms
- `gpresult /r` did not show the GPO under "Applied GPOs".
- User had correct OU membership.
- DNS resolution working.

## Root Cause
The GPO was linked to the wrong OU (`OU=USERS` instead of `OU=SALES`).

## Fix
1. Moved user to correct OU:
   `CN=Anderson.user5,OU=SALES,OU=DEPARTMENTS,OU=DUNNES,DC=DUNNES,DC=LOCAL`
2. Ran:
gpupdate /force
  
3. Confirmed with:
gpresult /r


## Result
GPO applied successfully.
Drive `F:` available in File Explorer.
