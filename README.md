# Cybersecurity Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured journey into cybersecurity — from core fundamentals and networking to hands-on labs, SIEM, and interview preparation.

My objectives with this repo:
- Build a strong foundation in cybersecurity concepts.
- Practice using real-world tools and scenarios.
- Document my progress in a clean, organized way.
- Prepare for cybersecurity interviews (SOC Analyst, Jr. Cybersecurity, IT Support).

>  Work in progress — constantly updated as I learn new topics and complete new labs.
