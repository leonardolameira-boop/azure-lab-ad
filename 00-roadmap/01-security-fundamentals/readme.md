# Security Fundamentals

This folder contains the core security concepts I’m learning and reviewing as part of my cybersecurity journey.  
I wanted to keep everything here in a simple and practical way, so I can easily revise these topics before interviews or when working on my labs.

These fundamentals appear everywhere in cybersecurity — in Active Directory, cloud, networking, SOC work, and even in everyday security decisions.  
So this folder serves as my “foundation layer” before diving into the more advanced topics.

##  What you will find here

Each `.md` file is a short, personal explanation that helps me understand and remember the concept:

- **cia-triad.md**  
  My notes on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability — the basic pillars of security.

- **iaaa.md**  
  Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. A simple way for me to remember how access control actually works.

- **least-privilege.md**  
  Why users and systems should only have the permissions they truly need.

- **zero-trust.md**  
  The “never trust, always verify” mindset and how it applies in environments like AD, cloud and SOC.

- **risk-assessment.md**  
  How to think about risks, threats, vulnerabilities and impact.

- **nist-framework.md**  
  My simplified summary of the NIST CSF’s five core functions.

- **cis-controls.md**  
  Notes on the CIS Controls and how they help reduce real-world attack surfaces.

- **security-policies.md**  
  The difference between policies, standards, guidelines and procedures — and why organizations need them.

##  Why this folder exists

I created this folder because I noticed that I was constantly revisiting these concepts while studying:

- Active Directory  
- Azure cloud security (AZ-900, SC-900…)  
- Networking basics  
- Blue Team / SOC workflows  
- Security tools like SIEM, Nmap and Wireshark  

Instead of searching all over the place, I wanted one simple hub where I could refresh the fundamentals quickly.

This folder helps me:
- Build a strong base before going deeper  
- Explain concepts clearly during interviews  
- Connect theory with my hands-on labs  
- Create a consistent study routine

## � How I use it

- Before interviews → quick review of each file  
- While building labs → checking concepts like Least Privilege, Zero Trust, CIA  
- While studying cloud or AD → reconnecting modern concepts with the fundamentals  
- When I get stuck → coming back to the basics usually helps everything make sense

##  Work in progress

I’ll keep refining these notes and adding new ones as I learn more.  
The idea is not to have “perfect textbook definitions”, but explanations that *I* understand and can confidently talk about.
