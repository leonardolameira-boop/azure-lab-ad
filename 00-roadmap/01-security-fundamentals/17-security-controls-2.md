# Security Controls (Technical, Administrative, Physical)

> **Short idea:**  
> Security controls are safeguards used to protect systems, data, and people. They are divided into three main types: Technical, Administrative, and Physical controls.

## 1. What Are Security Controls?

Security controls are the protections an organization uses to reduce risk, prevent attacks, detect threats, and safeguard information.  
They are grouped into three main categories:

- **Technical Controls** – technology-based protections  
- **Administrative Controls** – policies, rules, and procedures  
- **Physical Controls** – protections for buildings, equipment, and people  

These categories help structure a complete defense strategy.

## 2. Technical Controls

**Technical controls** (also called logical controls) use technology to enforce security.

### Purpose:
- Prevent, detect, or respond to attacks using automated systems  
- Protect data, networks, and systems  
- Reduce human error through technical safeguards  

### Examples:
- Firewalls  
- IDS/IPS  
- EDR / Antivirus  
- Encryption (data-at-rest, data-in-transit)  
- Access control lists (ACLs)  
- MFA (Multi-factor authentication)  
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)  
- Network segmentation  
- Patch management tools  
- Logging and monitoring systems (SIEM)

### Summary:
Technical controls = tools and technologies that enforce security.

## 3. Administrative Controls

**Administrative controls** (also called managerial or procedural controls) define *how* security should be managed.

### Purpose:
- Guide behavior  
- Establish rules and standards  
- Support compliance  
- Reduce risk through organization-wide policies  

### Examples:
- Security policies  
- Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)  
- Password policy  
- Access control policy  
- Incident response plan  
- Risk assessment procedures  
- Training and awareness programs  
- Vendor management controls  
- Hiring and termination processes  

### Summary:
Administrative controls = written rules, policies, and procedures.

## 4. Physical Controls

**Physical controls** protect people, buildings, equipment, and infrastructure.

### Purpose:
- Prevent unauthorized physical access  
- Protect hardware against theft or damage  
- Ensure safety of personnel  

### Examples:
- Badges and access cards  
- Security guards  
- CCTV cameras  
- Locked server rooms  
- Fences and gates  
- Biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition)  
- Fire suppression systems  
- Motion sensors  
- Turnstiles  
- Environmental controls (HVAC, humidity sensors)

### Summary:
Physical controls = protections for physical spaces and assets.

## 5. Comparison Table

| Control Type | Main Focus | Examples |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| Technical | Technology-based protections | Firewalls, IDS/IPS, encryption, MFA |
| Administrative | Policies and procedures | AUP, access policies, training, IR plan |
| Physical | Physical environment protection | Badges, locks, CCTV, guards |

## 6. How They Work Together (Defense in Depth)

Security controls overlap to create multiple layers of defense:

- Technical controls stop or detect cyberattacks  
- Administrative controls guide behavior and enforce rules  
- Physical controls protect infrastructure and hardware  

Together, they support:
- Zero Trust  
- Least Privilege  
- Risk Management  
- Incident Response  
- Compliance (ISO 27001, NIST, CIS)

## 7. Interview Explanation

Short version:
“Security controls are divided into technical, administrative, and physical categories. Technical controls are technology-based, administrative controls are policies and procedures, and physical controls protect the physical environment.”

Professional version:
“Security controls are safeguards used to reduce risk and protect information systems. They fall into three categories: technical controls (such as firewalls, MFA, and encryption), administrative controls (policies, training, and governance), and physical controls (badges, CCTV, locked server rooms). All three work together to support defense in depth and maintain a strong security posture.”

## 8. Key Takeaways

- Technical controls = technology that enforces security  
- Administrative controls = rules, policies, and governance  
- Physical controls = protections for buildings and hardware  
- Together they form a complete security strategy  
- Used in NIST, CIS Controls, ISO 27001, and Zero Trust  
- Common topic in cybersecurity interviews
