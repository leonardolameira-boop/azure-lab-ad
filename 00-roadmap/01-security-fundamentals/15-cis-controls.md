# CIS Controls (Critical Security Controls)

> **Short idea:**  
> CIS Controls are a set of prioritized, practical security actions designed to help organizations defend against the most common cyberattacks.

## 1. What Are CIS Controls?

The **CIS Critical Security Controls** are a list of **18 prioritized security best practices** created by the Center for Internet Security (CIS).  
They guide organizations on what to protect first based on real-world cyberattack data.

CIS Controls provide a clear, practical roadmap for improving security, especially for SOC, blue team, cloud, and IT operations.

They are divided into **basic, foundational, and organizational** categories.

## 2. Why CIS Controls Matter

CIS Controls are important because they:

- Focus on **real attacks happening today**  
- Provide **step-by-step actions** to reduce risk  
- Are **clear, simple, and practical**  
- Help organizations quickly improve their security posture  
- Are used worldwide in SOCs, security teams, and compliance programs  

They complement frameworks like:
- NIST CSF  
- ISO 27001  
- Zero Trust  
- Cloud security baselines

## 3. The 18 CIS Critical Controls (Latest Version)

Below is a simplified overview of each control:

1. **Inventory of Enterprise Assets** – Know all devices (laptops, servers, IoT).  
2. **Inventory of Software Assets** – Know all applications running.  
3. **Data Protection** – Classify and secure sensitive data.  
4. **Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software** – Hardening.  
5. **Account Management** – Manage all accounts (users, admins, service accounts).  
6. **Access Control Management** – Least privilege and authorization.  
7. **Continuous Vulnerability Management** – Scan, find, and patch vulnerabilities.  
8. **Audit Log Management** – Centralize logs, monitor events.  
9. **Email and Web Browser Protections** – Limit phishing and browser attacks.  
10. **Malware Defenses** – Antivirus, EDR, prevention tools.  
11. **Data Recovery** – Backups and secure restoration.  
12. **Network Infrastructure Management** – Secure network devices and configs.  
13. **Network Monitoring and Defense** – IDS/IPS, monitoring, segmentation.  
14. **Security Awareness and Skills Training** – Train users about threats.  
15. **Service Provider Management** – Secure third-party access.  
16. **Application Software Security** – Secure development practices.  
17. **Incident Response Management** – Response plan, roles, playbooks.  
18. **Penetration Testing** – Simulate attacks to test defenses.

## 4. CIS Controls Summary Table

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Basic Controls | Essential actions to begin securing the environment | Asset inventory, data protection, vulnerability management |
| Foundational Controls | Strengthen defenses across systems | Logging, malware defense, secure configuration |
| Organizational Controls | Improve processes and governance | Training, vendor management, incident response |

## 5. How CIS Controls Relate to Other Concepts

### **Least Privilege**  
Present in:  
- Access Control  
- Account Management  

### **Zero Trust**  
Reinforced through:  
- Continuous monitoring  
- Authorization controls  
- Network segmentation  

### **Defense in Depth**  
CIS Controls layer protections across assets, users, network, applications, and operations.

### **Risk Management**  
Controls help reduce likelihood and impact of common attacks.

## 6. CIS Controls in SOC / Blue Team Operations

SOC analysts interact with CIS Controls daily:

- Control 8 → Log management (SIEM)  
- Control 13 → Network monitoring (IDS/IPS)  
- Control 17 → Incident response  
- Control 10 → Malware defense (EDR/XDR)  
- Control 7 → Vulnerability management  
- Control 5/6 → Account and access control  

These controls match real-world workflow.

## 7. How To Explain CIS Controls in an Interview

Short version:
“CIS Controls are a set of 18 prioritized security best practices that help organizations defend against the most common cyberattacks.”

Professional version:
“CIS Controls are a practical, prioritized list of security actions created based on real attack data. They include asset management, secure configuration, logging, monitoring, vulnerability management, access control, and incident response. CIS Controls simplify implementation of security programs and are widely used by SOC teams and organizations to improve their security posture.”

## 8. Key Takeaways

- CIS Controls are practical, prioritized, and attack-focused  
- They help organizations know **what to secure first**  
- They align with NIST, Zero Trust, and cloud security  
- Great for SOC and Blue Team understanding  
- Clear and simple for beginners and experts
