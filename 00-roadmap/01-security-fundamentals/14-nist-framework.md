# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)

> **Short idea:**  
> The NIST Cybersecurity Framework defines five core functions — Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover — that guide organizations in managing and reducing cybersecurity risks.

## 1. What Is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)** is a globally recognized guide created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations:

- Understand cybersecurity risks  
- Build structured security programs  
- Prioritize protections  
- Improve incident response and recovery  

It is not a law or a strict checklist — it is a **guideline** that any organization can adapt.

The framework is divided into **five core functions**.

## 2. The Five Core Functions of NIST CSF

### 1) Identify  
Understand what needs protection.

Examples:
- Asset inventory  
- Risk assessment  
- Business context  
- Vulnerability identification  
- Governance  

Purpose:  
Know your environment before trying to protect it.

---

### 2) Protect  
Implement safeguards to reduce the likelihood of a security incident.

Examples:
- Access control  
- MFA  
- Network segmentation  
- Awareness training  
- Data encryption  
- Hardening and patching  

Purpose:  
Reduce or stop threats before they cause harm.

---

### 3) Detect  
Identify when something suspicious or malicious is happening.

Examples:
- SIEM alerts  
- IDS/IPS  
- Log monitoring  
- Behavioral analytics  
- Threat detection tools  

Purpose:  
Discover incidents quickly.

---

### 4) Respond  
Take action when a security incident occurs.

Examples:
- Incident Response plan  
- Notification and communication steps  
- Containment strategies  
- Forensic analysis  
- Playbooks  

Purpose:  
Minimize damage and control the situation.

---

### 5) Recover  
Restore normal operations after an incident.

Examples:
- Backups and restoration  
- System rebuilding  
- Post-incident review  
- Improvements to avoid future incidents  

Purpose:  
Return to normal and strengthen the security posture.

## 3. NIST CSF Summary Table

| Function  | Goal | Examples |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Identify  | Know what you must protect | Asset inventory, risk assessment |
| Protect   | Prevent incidents | MFA, encryption, patching |
| Detect    | Find incidents fast | SIEM, IDS, monitoring |
| Respond   | Contain and manage incidents | IR plan, playbooks |
| Recover   | Restore services | Backups, rebuild, lessons learned |

## 4. Why NIST CSF Is Important

- Provides a universal language for cybersecurity  
- Helps prioritize what to protect first  
- Provides structure and maturity to security programs  
- Required or recommended by many industries  
- Helps companies meet compliance standards  
- Used by SOCs, blue teams, CISOs, cloud teams, and security analysts  

For beginners, NIST CSF helps you understand **how security works as a whole**.

## 5. NIST CSF in a SOC / Blue Team Context

A SOC analyst interacts with NIST functions daily:

- Identify → asset lists, vulnerabilities  
- Protect → firewall rules, access control  
- Detect → alerts, SIEM, threat hunting  
- Respond → incident handling  
- Recover → verifying systems are restored  

This framework matches real-world SOC workflows.

## 6. How To Explain NIST CSF in an Interview

Short version:
“NIST CSF organizes cybersecurity into five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. It helps organizations understand risks and structure their security programs.”

Professional version:
“NIST CSF is a widely used security framework that helps organizations manage cybersecurity risks. It defines five core functions: Identify (understand assets and risks), Protect (implement safeguards), Detect (monitor anomalies), Respond (take action during incidents), and Recover (restore operations).  
It provides structure, improves maturity, and aligns security with business priorities.”

## 7. Key Takeaways

- NIST CSF is simple but powerful  
- It breaks security into five universal functions  
- Works for any organization  
- Helps SOCs, security teams, and cloud environments  
- Not a law — a flexible guideline  
- Easy to reference in interviews and documentation
