# Cybersecurity Learning Roadmap

This folder contains my high-level study roadmap — the sequence I’m following to build a solid foundation in cybersecurity and progress toward SOC Analyst / Blue Team roles.  
It includes learning priorities, milestones, certifications, and the labs I plan to complete.

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Goal
Become a SOC Analyst (Tier 1 → Tier 2) with strong foundations in networking, Windows/Linux administration, Active Directory, scripting, and Blue Team operations.

---

## 📌 Learning Order (Current Roadmap)

### **1. Security Fundamentals (Now)**
- CIA Triad  
- IAAA  
- Least Privilege  
- Zero Trust  
- Risk Assessment  
- NIST Framework / CIS Controls  
**Reason:** These principles guide every security decision I’ll make later.

---

### **2. Networking Basics**
- OSI / TCP-IP  
- Subnetting  
- Ports & Protocols  
- DNS / DHCP  
- Packet flow  
**Reason:** Everything in security relies on understanding how data moves.

---

### **3. Linux & Windows Foundations**
- Linux commands, logs, services  
- Windows administration  
- PowerShell basics  
**Reason:** SOC analysts handle both environments daily.

---

### **4. Active Directory & Identity**
- Domains, OUs, groups  
- Kerberos, NTLM  
- NTFS permissions  
- GPOs  
**Reason:** AD is the heart of most corporate environments.

---

### **5. Attacks & Defenses**
- Malware types  
- Phishing  
- DDoS  
- MITM / Sniffing  
- SQL Injection  
**Reason:** Understand attacker techniques before building detections.

---

### **6. Tools (Nmap, Wireshark)**
- Network scanning  
- Packet capture  
- Traffic analysis  
**Reason:** Build technical skills for triage, investigation, and detections.

---

### **7. SIEM & Blue Team**
- Log sources (Windows, AD, network)  
- Correlation rules  
- Detection engineering basics  
**Reason:** Essential for SOC workflows.

---

### **8. Python for Cybersecurity**
- Scripts for automation  
- Log parsing  
- Simple detection utilities  
**Reason:** Scripting improves efficiency in investigations.

---

### **9. Hands-On Labs**
All labs are stored in **10-personal-labs/**:
- Active Directory Lab  
- Nmap Lab  
- Wireshark Lab  
- SIEM Lab
